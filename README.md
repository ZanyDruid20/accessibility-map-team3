# accessibility-map-team3
The Accessibility Campus Map is an internal university application designed to  assist students, faculty, and staff in navigating campus through routes that meet accessibility needs. The system provides alternate pathways that avoid stairs and other barriers, ensuring that individuals with temporary or permanent mobility limitations can move across campus efficiently and independently. The application also supports users who may be carrying equipment, pushing carts, or cycling by offering safer, step-free routes between buildings. The tool integrates a searchable interactive map, pathway data, and accessibility features such as elevators, ramps, and automatic doors. The development team of this project consists of Kaila Hoskins, Andrew Lam, Furnom Dam, and Sanaa Thomas.
