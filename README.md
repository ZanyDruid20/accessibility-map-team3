# Accessibility Map

Campus-wide accessibility navigation system built as a team project to support students and visitors with mobility needs.

## My Role
I worked as one of two backend engineers on the team, responsible for backend services including authentication logic, routing constraints, and database schema design. I independently handled deployment and stabilization of the FastAPI backend on Railway, resolving configuration and runtime issues discovered through collaborative testing with teammates.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Railway
- JavaScript (frontend integration)

## Highlights
- Backend schema and logic for 300+ accessibility nodes across 17+ buildings
- Production deployment on Railway
- Processed 614+ API calls during testing with <200 ms latency and 0% error rate after final fixes

## Notes
This repository is forked from a team project and contains shared team code. Descriptions above highlight my backend-focused contributions and sole ownership of deployment and stabilization.
