# Accessibility Map

Campus-wide accessibility navigation system built as a team project to support students and visitors with mobility needs.

## My Role
I worked on the backend services, including authentication logic, routing constraints, and database schema design. I also helped deploy and stabilize the backend on Railway and improved reliability based on real usage and stakeholder feedback with my teammate.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Railway
- JavaScript (frontend integration)

## Highlights
- Backend schema and logic for 300+ accessibility nodes across 17+ buildings
- Production deployment on Railway
- Processed 614+ API calls with <200 ms latency and 0% error rate after final fixes

## Notes
This repository is forked from a team project. Contributions shown here reflect my individual work on the backend.
